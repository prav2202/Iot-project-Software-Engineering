# Soil Moisture, Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

# Problem Statement
The conventional garden does not have a monitoring system to monitor the temperature, humidity and soil moisture of the garden. With implementation of sensors and IoT, we can get real time data of the temperature, humidity and soil moisture in the garden. 

# Design Statement
	1. To determine the temperature of the surroundings in the garden.
	2. To determine the humidity of the garden.
	3. To determine the soil moisture value of the soil in the garden.
